```{python}
import plotly.express as px

tips = px.data.tips()
max_tip = int(tips.tip.max())
common_day = tips.day.mode()[0]
```

You can then use these variables in your narrative like this:

The max tip amount was `{python} max_tip`.

The most common day in the tips dataset was `{python} common_day`.
